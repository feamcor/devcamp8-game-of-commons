# DevCamp8: Game of commons

This is the official repository for the [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) DevCamp 8 -- a community organized learning event for developers who want to develop on Holochain.
Here we present a step-by-step Holochain based implementation of the classical economics game [Tragedy of commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). The word "tragedy" is removed from the name of our version for a more positive spin :)

## Context

We decided to implement a game for a few reasons:
1. (almost) no data input required. There are a lot of decentralized app examples that copy the existing platforms, such as twitter/youtube and so on, but all of them require users to actually start producing the data (which is often made up) to get familiar with the decentralized UX. Here, you just need to try and play the game.
2. it's collaborative. One of the main points of all decentralized apps is to enable/improve collaboration, so it seems logical to choose collaborative use-case for a decentralized framework intro. It also allows us to easily demostrate all the major implications of the Holochain's eventual consistency.
